# Colosseum
Colosseum is an online multiplayer JRPG focused around a competition between players.
Players create and develop several characters and go up against other players in combat.
Players are ranked according to their skill level, with better performing players getting access to additional content such as locations, abilities, housing, and more.

As a player increases in ranking their pool of possible challengers shrinks, and they're given access to larger arenas.
Players are able to spectate other players at any time during matches, even as they wait for their own matches to begin.

In order to acquire items and equipment for combat, players can go on expeditions together to find gear or gather materials for use in simple crafting.
